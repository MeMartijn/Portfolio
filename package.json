It seems like there is an issue with the code as it is not displaying the desired output. However, without seeing the code itself, it is difficult to provide specific improvements. 

Here are some general suggestions to improve code quality:

1. Ensure that all necessary libraries and modules are imported correctly and used appropriately in the code.
2. Use meaningful variable and function names to make the code more readable.
3. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code.
4. Break down complex tasks into smaller functions or modules for better maintainability and reusability.
5. Handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during execution using try-catch blocks.
6. Use consistent indentation and formatting.
7. Remove any unnecessary code or redundant statements.
8. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the code.
9. Consider using efficient algorithms or data structures to optimize execution time and memory usage.

If you can provide the actual code, I can provide more specific recommendations.
